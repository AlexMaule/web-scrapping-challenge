# web-scrapping-challenge
Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. And, scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Data
The data utilized for this challenge was scrapped from the Website: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html
Which in turn collected it's data from NASA's Website.
The data isn't very extensive nor fresh since this dataset has info from Septempber 2012 to February 2018. Still good enough to do some analysis.

## Analysis
In this analysis, it's answered the questions:
  1. How many months exist on Mars?
  2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
  3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
    * Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
    * Plot the results as a bar chart.
  4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
    * Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
    * Plot the results as a bar chart.
  5.About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
    * Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
    * Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
